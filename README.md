# cortex-teachCWU

This project is created for the MET class at CWU in support of their robot based of the standard clawbot.  The project is organized where there is a set of src/header fiels per mechanical subsection of the ultimate robot.  For exampel all driverelated functiosn are organized in the the chassis.c and chassis.h

Students should FORK the project to their own gitHub account, rename the project to their assigned team, and then use the template to subsequenty make modifications.

Studnets should consult the file portdef.h to ensure that the port assignement match their robot, and subsequently either update the portdef.h file matching their configuration, or moving devices to ports as shown in the protdef.h file.

If multiple student in a group will be programming on the robot using multiple computers, you should make sure you understand how to check out branches of the repository, subsequently merge branches into a release so that code is not overwritten.
